A class final turned mini-passion project that explores different machine learning methods for predicting public transit ridership, comparing classic models like Random Forest and Stacking Ensembles with deep learning approaches like LSTMs and Conv-GCNs. It looks at how well these models handle time and location-based patterns in ridership data and their strengths and weaknesses. The results show that ensemble models are great for long-term forecasting because they're efficient and easy to interpret, while deep learning models perform better for short-term predictions. Overall, the paper highlights how ML can improve transit planning and operations while tackling challenges like data quality, computation, and explainability.
